I first heard about 12 startups in 12 months from [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). The idea is to build a startup each month for a whole year. When I say 'startups', I'm really talking about products. Small MVPs that can be built in a single month. The idea appeals to me because last year I spend months building a product only to give up on it and ship nothing else for the rest of the year. Shipping a new product every month takes the pressure off. The emphasis is on shipping not building the perfect product.

If I keep making products I believe that one of them will eventually show traction. It's a manifestation of the phrase: "throw things against the wall and see what sticks".

### The Good

I took up the challenge in July and shipped [CommitCheck](https://commitcheck.com) then [PR Scheduler](https://prscheduler.com) in August.

* I learned to cut scope and build the simplest thing users would find valuable
* I created forward momentum to keep working on my projects, every day
* I got more involved in communities like IndieHackers and ProductHunt to see what other people were building

I recommend the 12 startups challenge to anyone who wants to make products but has put it off.

### The Bad

Pieter Levels didn't finish. I don't think anyone would. In fact, I don't think finishing is a good outcome. If you're shipping useful products people will start using them. They will find bugs, request features and send you emails. This is a drain on your time but you shouldn't ignore it. It's the early signs of product-market-fit. The thing startups are searching for.

In my case, I've had some traction with both products. [CommitCheck](https://commitcheck.com) has around 30 users and [PR Scheduler](https://prscheduler.com) about 10. I've fixed numerous bugs, implemented many new features and spent time emailing customers.

I've decided not to neglect my existing projects in order to ship a third in September. I will build a third product but it will be a few months down the line when my existing projects are further along.

### Do it but don't expect to finish it

To summarise my thoughts: Anyone who wants to build products but has trouble shipping should absolutely try 12 startups in 12 months. But I don't think you'll finish it and that's just great.
