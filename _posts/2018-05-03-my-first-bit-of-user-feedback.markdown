I’ve talked about trying to [get my first user](http://tomkadwill.com/getting-my-first-user). I still haven’t released my product idea publicly but I’ve had a small breakthrough. My friend referred me to someone who may need the tool I’m building.

This is awesome. I need to add a small feature in order to meet this person's requirements. This is exactly how I hope to build the product. Only building new features based on user feedback.

I was first introduced to this methodology by the book [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kadwill-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0670921602&linkId=8871c8bef633b1c7ae1321c0f322fce6). For anyone who hasn’t read it, it’s an amazing book. One of the takeaways, for me, was that startups should constantly seek out user feedback and trying to build things that users want. Building for 6 months in isolation is a mistake.
