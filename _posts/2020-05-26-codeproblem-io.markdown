I'm starting a new project. I've bought a domain - it's [codeproblem.io](https://codeproblem.io).

#### What is it?
I'm building a site that provides solutions and explanation for code problems from sites like Codewars, Hacker Rank and Project Euler.

#### Who is it aimed at?
* People who want to get better at coding problems for job interviews
* People who want to improve their foundational CS and programming skills
* People who want to get better at competitive programming

#### Monetization
Initially I'll use unobtrusive ads (as much as ads can be unobtrusive). Either from direct ad deals or via Carbon Ads.

In the future I may be able to provide a paid course or e-book for users who want extra help.

#### Why did I decide to start it?
I've been practicing programming challenges a lot recently. It's useful for future job interviews (not that I'm looking). More importantly I think it will make me a better programmer. But, when I get stuck on a hard problem it's difficult to know how to improve. For example, what algorithm knowledge am I missing? Is there a core language feature that I don't know about?

I hope that [codeproblem.io](https://codeproblem.io) will help me get better at programming problems and help others too.
