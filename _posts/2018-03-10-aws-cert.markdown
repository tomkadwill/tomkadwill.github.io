Recently I’ve been learning more about AWS. I bought a subscription to [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) and I’ve been working through the material. I’ve been learning a lot.

However, I’ve decided against taking the AWS certifications. Here’s why:

1. **AWS is changing so quickly that the certifications become out of date quickly**. I know this because A Cloud Guru frequently mentions parts of AWS that have changed for which the certification hasn’t caught up. I’m not willing to learn out of date information, just to pass a course.
2. **I don’t need to prove my knowledge**. I don’t want to work as a Devops engineer doing AWS stuff full time. I just want to learn about AWS so that I can build products. Therefore, I’m happy to use A Cloud Guru as a resource for learning without feeling the need to gain the certs.
