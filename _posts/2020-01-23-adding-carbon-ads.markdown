I spend a lot of time building products and writing about products. So far I have not been able to make any money from it. [CommitCheck](https://commitcheck.com) and [PR Scheduler](https://prscheduler.com) are growing but have not reached the point where they can be monetized. Making money is not my primary goal, I already have a software job that pays well. However, I would like to make some money to justify my time.

My first idea is to use [Carbon Ads](https://www.carbonads.net). I don't generally like online advertising but I don't mind targeted, minimal ads. Carbon Ads are tech focused, discreet and tasteful.

With my current traffic numbers I'll be making about $5 a month. Not exactly life changing. However, I think there's a reasonable chance that this site grows 10x or 100x. With those traffic numbers, ad revenue would cover investment in my side projects and perhaps a new MBP every 3 years 🙏.

Last thing, I'd like to ask for your help. If you enjoy my site and use an ad blocker, please consider whitelisting tomkadwill.com. I'll only ever show a single, tech related ad on each page. Thank you.
