I'm using Trello to manage my [CommitCheck](https://commitcheck.com), [PR Scheduler](https://prscheduler.com) and this blog. I've use tools like JIRA and Pivotal tracker for working with teams but Trello works great for me as a solo developer. In this post I'll describe my workflow and explain why Trello is a great took for solo devs and indie hackers.

Here is a screenshot of my Trello board:

TODO: screenshot here.

You can see that I have a few columns: Ideas, Ideas shipped, Icebox, TODOs, In Progress and Done. Let me explain what the colunns are for and then I'll explain my workflow.

* **Ideas** is where I put any new project idea. Typically these are bigger project that's need breaking down into stories. CommitCheck is an example of one of these.
* **Ideas shipped** I use this list which ideas have been shipped. I don't really need this list, I could just move ideas straight to done but I keep this list for motivation. It helps me remember what I've shipped and is a good reference for what I've achieved. It also keeps me motivated to ship more projects in the future.
* **Icebox** This is where I put smaller ideas (those that are small enough to be worked on) but I'm not sure whether they should be worked on or not. For example, one of the cards is "Allow Regex to be run on commits/pr_description/pr_title using and/or". This was a feature requested by a user which they've now gone quiet on. I haven't had anyone else request this feature so I'm not yet sure whether it's worth working on.
* **TODOs** This is essentially my backlog. It's a list of tickets that are ready to be worked on that I think are important to do. I try to prioritize this list so that I can just pick the next ticket off the top when I'm ready to work on something new.
* **In Progress** These are tickets that I'm currently working on.
* **Done** The last column is for tickets that I've built, shipped, validated and done.
