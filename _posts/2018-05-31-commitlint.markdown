Today I’ve released [CommitLint](https://commitlint.com/).

It’s a tool I build to solve a specific problem. To prevent GitHub pull requests from being merged unless all commits contain a JIRA number. You see, having a ticket number on every commit message is very useful when looking back through history and trying to figure out which piece of code corresponds to which ticket.

I expanded the original idea and built CommitLint, which allows users to check commit messages against any regular expression. Here is a short video about how it works:

If you think you’d find CommitLint useful, please sign up.

Also, I’d love to get your feedback. Please [email me](mailto) your thoughts about CommitLint, good or bad. [email me](mailto) with feature requests. [email me](mailto) about documentation or installation. Absolutely anything, I want to hear from you.
