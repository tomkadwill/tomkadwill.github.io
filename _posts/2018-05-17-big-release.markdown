It’s difficult to know when to release your creation to the world. I’ve blogged about the benefits of [getting users as early as possible](http://tomkadwill.com/getting-my-first-user). However, this hasn’t yielded much success for me as I haven’t managed to acquire any real users.

So, I’m going to release my product publicly to see whether it generates any interest. I’ll be following the strategy that Peter Levels describes in [Turning side projects into profitable startups](https://levels.io/startups/). Briefly, the plan is:

* Post on ProductHunt
* Post on relevant subreddits
* Post on Hackernews
* Beg my friends to upvote so that it is seen by as many people as possible :D

The product is almost ready and I hope to release within the next 2 weeks.

This reaffirms how useful it is to have an audience. I'm sure products can be successful without one but having an audience allows you to get all important user feedback, early.
