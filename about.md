I'm a full stack developer, based in the UK. I've been creating things on the web for 8 years now. During that time I've worked for some high profile tech companies including Funding Circle, Babylon Health & NotOnTheHighStreet. I've also worked for some small startups whose names you wouldn't have heard of. You can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:tomkadwill@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/tomkadwill">Twitter</a>.

### A little more..

I'm passionate about software, technology and design. I spend most of my time working with Ruby and JavaScript. Throughout my career I've worked on both backend and frontend.

I love to [write](/posts) and publish [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/kadwill/videos) about the stuff I'm building.
