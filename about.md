I'm a full stack developer, based in the UK. I've been creating things on the web for 8 years now. During that time I've worked for some high profile tech companies including Funding Circle, Babylon Health & NotOnTheHighStreet. I've also worked for some small startups whose names you wouldn't have heard of. You can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:tomkadwill@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/tomkadwill">Twitter</a>.

### A little more..

I'm passionate about software, technology and design. I spend most of my time working with Ruby and JavaScript. Throughout my career I've worked on both backend and frontend.

I love to write, mostly on [this blog](/) but I've also written for [StackAbuse](https://stackabuse.com/author/tom). And occasionally I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/kadwill/videos).

Over the years I've created and contributed to many projects, some OSS and some not. You can follow me on [GitHub](http://github.com/tomkadwill) and [ProductHunt](https://www.indiehackers.com/tomkadwill) to keep up to date with my stuff. The projects that I currently maintain are:
