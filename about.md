Hi, I'm Tom Kadwill and I make stuff on the internet. By day I work as a software developer, by night I build [products](/projects), [write](/) and occasionally post [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/kadwill/videos).

I'm interested in technology, [software products](https://www.producthunt.com/@tomkadwill), UX and [bootstrapped businesses](https://www.indiehackers.com/tomkadwill).

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomkadwill) or by <a href="mailto:tomkadwill@gmail.com">email</a>.
