My name is Tom Kadwill. I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/tomkadwill) and occasional [writer](/). I live just outside
London, in a place called Leigh on Sea. I work for a healthtech startup called Ryalto. I blog about technology, code, web
and other related topics.

I built a SaaS product called [CommitLint](https://commitlint.com). I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomkadwill).
I've made some [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/kadwill/videos).
